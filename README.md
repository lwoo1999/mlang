    * cubical TT see
         * *Cubical Type Theory: a constructive interpretation of the univalence axiom*
         * *On Higher Inductive Types in Cubical Type Theory*
         * *Higher inductive types in cubical computational type theory*
         * *Syntax and Models of Cartesian Cubical Type Theory*
* implementation
    * the type checker is written in a bidirectional way, some reference is
         * *A simple type-theoretic language: Mini-TT*
         * http://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/
    * but the above reference is not incremental, and to do it incrementally: *Decidability of conversion for type theory in type theory*
      * this don't handle recursive definitions, and we use a way inspired by Mini-TT
    * the idea of using JVM as evaluator is from: *Full reduction at full throttle*



### values

we represent recursive references directly by recursive data structure

and application, projection, reference as redex

for example `define a = a` will be of code `val r = RecursiveReference(null); val a = r.deref(); r.value = a; a`

where `deref` is a redex and under normal evaluation rule, it will evaluate to `null` which will be rejected

this means non-guarded recursive references will be rejected by evaluator

for a guarded recursive reference, then it is ok, for example `val r = RecursiveReference(null); val a = Lambda(_ â‡’ r.deref()); r.value = a; a`

when we evaluate `a(something)` we will get `a` again

a recursive type like `nat` is ok because we consider the record and constructor fields as guarded

`eval`, reductions and closures all take a parameter of reduction strategy

so the default reduction strategy has the property:

* it don't accept non-guarded value definitions, which is non-terminating anyway
* it will always fully evaluate to normal forms, **except** under closures, this means the non-guarded part will not have any reference or recursive reference,
and it will be exactly like a theory without recursive reference and references
* one-time substitution is always terminating **?????** (TODO really? assuming we have termination checker, can we have this property???)


### conversion checking

the conversion checking compared to the literature is wired, because it doesn't have de Bruijn indices, so it uses a unique id for open variables, so we don't need to do index shuffling, I don't know if this is correct actually.

the assumptions is: values is well typed, although values don't have type annotations, but for example a stuck term of application, if you know the left hand side has a function type, then you know that right hand side has the type of the domain

so the algorithm is type directed is in this sense: the type is a **assertion** that both terms has a certain type, the level input of `equalType` is a **assertion** that both type is smaller than a certain level, the output of a equality check is a **assertion** that the term is definitional equal.

in case of `equalNeutural`, there is no assertion that the two input is of the same type, it has a return type `Option[Value]` and `Some(v)` is a **assertion** that the two neutral type is of the same type, **and of the same value** and the type is `v`

#### how to handle recursive definitions

it seems to me Agda and Mini-TT handles the problem of readback recursive definitions by: when reading back (or conversion checking) pattern matching neutral value, instead of reading back all the cases (add thus ends up in an infinite loop, for example when reading back `(plus a b)` where a, b is open variable), it only reads back an id of the pattern matching lambda, since a pattern matching lambda is uniquely defined by its src position. (about Agda is only guessing, because Agda seems to have a nominal definitional equality for pattern matching) 


it is extended in our case, by also allowing the id to be different, but as an assumption see `Conversion.scala`
